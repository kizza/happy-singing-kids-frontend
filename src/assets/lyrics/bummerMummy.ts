You might have met her she ain’t new in town,
Just raise your voice and she’ll begin to frown

Bummer mummy,
Bummer mummy,
She might just be the crankiest mummy around.

Can’t find your socks cos your room’s a mess,
You can see the lines as she begins to stress

Bummer mummy,
Bummer mummy,
She might just be the crankiest mummy around.

If you don’t believe me just try this out,
Put on her favourite lipstick, she’ll begin to shout

Bummer mummy,
Bummer mummy,
She might just be the crankiest mummy around.

Haven’t done your homework, you’re late for school,
Hope she won’t notice but she ain’t no fool

Bummer mummy,
Bummer mummy,
She might just be the crankiest mummy around.

Do the bummer mummy dance!

Mosey on up with your attitude,
You’ll find out quick that she’s not in the mood.

Bummer mummy,
Bummer mummy,
She might just be the crankiest mummy around.
