Hush my love, my baby, good night.
See the stars and the moon shining bright.
Dream of far away places,
Dance with angels and feel all our love.

Lullaby, sweet angel, goodnight.
Daylightâ€™s gone and the sun has closed its eyes.
Gentle song that surrounds you,
Feel the love and all peace from on high.

Hush my love, my baby, good night.
See the stars and the moon shining bright.
Dream of far away places,
Dance with angels and feel all our love.
