I was sitting with my teddies
on the picnic rug,
Eating tea and biccies
and then a bull ant bit my bum.

I had an uh oh spaghetti-o
Illy willy dang dong,
Whoopsy doo
Uh oh spaghetti-o
Illy willy dang dong doo!

(Oh really hurt)

I was running round in circles,
Playing duck, duck, goose,
I went to tag a friend
And then I slipped and chipped my tooth.

I had an uh oh spaghetti-o
Illy willy dang dong,
Whoopsy doo
Uh oh spaghetti-o
Illy willy dang dong doo!

(Dentist time!)

I was wearing my new undies,
The ones that I love most,
But then I got distracted
And they got a little soaked (oo)

I had an uh oh spaghetti-o
Illy willy dang dong,
Whoopsy doo
Uh oh spaghetti-o
Illy willy dang dong doo!

I was playing on the monkey bars,
Swinging with my friends (whee!),
I tried to do a flip
And I fell and bumped my head.

I had an uh oh spaghetti-o
Illy willy dang dong,
Whoopsy doo
Uh oh spaghetti-o
Illy willy dang dong doo!

I was at my favourite restaurant,
With my Mum and Dad,
Eating spaghetti and meatballs
And one landed on my lap.

I had an uh oh spaghetti-o
Illy willy dang dong,
Whoopsy doo
Uh oh spaghetti-o
Illy willy dang dong doo!

Uh oh spaghetti-o
Illy willy dang dong,
Whoopsy doo
Uh oh spaghetti-o
Illy willy dang dong doo!
